# 🚗🚗🚙🚙🏁🏆 Ultimate Racer

**An emoji-only turn-based racing game built for Chainguard's Vibelympics.**

Race your blue car 🚙 against an AI opponent 🚗 around an emoji track. The twist? **Zero text in the UI** — everything you see is emoji.

## The Game

- **Momentum-based movement**: Your velocity carries over each turn. Plan your moves carefully!
- **Checkpoint racing**: Pass through 1️⃣ → 2️⃣ → 3️⃣ → 🏁 to complete the lap
- **Penalties**: Go off-track onto grass 🟩 or hit the audience 😃→💀 and you'll skip a turn
- **Smart AI**: The opponent uses waypoint navigation to race competitively

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS**
- **Static web app** — runs entirely in the browser, no backend needed
- **Docker** with Chainguard Node image

## Quick Start

```bash
make dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```
