    fix: Remove house hover scaling, zoom in camera, reposition version labels
    
    - Removed useFrame scaling effect on house hover (houses no longer change size)
    - Zoomed in camera from position [0, 2, 6] to [0, 1.5, 3.5] with fov 50
    - Camera now looks at y=0.3 instead of y=0.5 for better house visibility
    - Version labels repositioned from y=-0.15 to lying flat on the ground (z=0.6)
    - Labels rotated -90 degrees on X axis to lie flat
    - Increased font size from 0.1 to 0.12 for better readability
    - Houses now appear larger and more prominent in the view

    fix: Floor extension, fire positioning with noise, SNYK link, post-it hover bug
    
    Package Overview Fixes:
    - Fixed floor disappearing when scrolling to right: Ground plane now centered and sized based on total house width
    - Added noise to fire x/y positions using seeded random for visual interest
    - Added transparency to flame layers (0.7-0.95 opacity)
    - Fire sizes now range from 0.5x to 2x based on severity (LOW=0.5x, MODERATE=1x, HIGH=1.5x, CRITICAL=2x)
    - Fires overflow to floor when 5+ vulnerabilities (max 4 on roof, rest around house on floor)
    
    Version Overview Fixes:
    - Added SNYK link to header - clicking package name opens Snyk security page for that version
    - Fixed text disappearing on post-it hover: Moved entire group forward on hover instead of just mesh
    - Text z-positions now properly layered in front of the mesh
    - Used seeded random for consistent post-it rotations

    fix: Address UI issues - door transparency, version filtering, search UI hiding, camera positioning
    
    - Made door transparent (opacity 0.3) so it doesn't overlap house face
    - Filter out auxiliary packages with commit hash names (hex strings without dots)
    - Hide search UI (header + form) when viewing vulnerability details inside house
    - Moved camera closer to post-it notes wall for better readability
    - Post-it notes now larger (1.8x1.4) with bigger text
    - Added vertical scrolling for vulnerability lists with 20+ items
    - 3-column layout for post-it notes instead of 4 for better use of space
    - Scroll controls only shown when there are 6+ vulnerabilities
    - urllib3 now shows 104 proper semver versions instead of 112 with hashes

    fix: Address UI issues - horizontal houses, version labels, fire overlap, scrolling, backgrounds, 3D vulnerability view
    
    - Houses now arranged in horizontal line with version labels underneath
    - Fires spaced properly on roof to prevent overlap (max 5 fires per house)
    - Implemented proper horizontal scrolling with camera controller and slider
    - Changed background color to light gray #FAFBFD per requirements
    - Malicious package view now has red background with distant fires and sign in front of house
    - Vulnerability detail view is now fully 3D inside house with post-it notes on wall
    - Side walls shown partially/cutoff as per spec
    - Post-it notes display severity badges, CVE IDs, summaries, and version info
    - Updated SearchForm and App styling for light theme

    Phase 1-3: 3D house visualization and full frontend-backend integration
    
    Completed features:
    - 3D houses with pastel colors representing package versions
    - Animated fire effects for vulnerabilities (size/intensity based on severity)
    - Faces on houses (happy/grim/horrified based on vuln count)
    - Malicious package detection with red background and warning banner
    - Background fires for malicious packages
    - URL parameter support (?package=name) for auto-search
    - Fixed malicious detection to avoid false positives
    
    3D Visualization:
    - Houses rendered with Three.js and @react-three/fiber
    - OrbitControls for navigation (scroll/drag)
    - Version labels on each house
    - Fire tooltips showing CVE info on hover
    
    Tested packages:
    - flask: Multiple houses with fires (59 versions)
    - urllib3: Many versions (112), no false malicious flag
    - controlurl: Correctly shows malicious package warning

    Phase 0-2: Docker setup complete + Backend API with OSV integration
    
    - Fixed Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT issues for Chainguard images
    - Backend successfully queries OSV API for package vulnerabilities
    - Malicious package detection working (MAL- prefix, summary/details check)
    - Tested with urllib3 (many vulnerabilities) and controlurl (malicious)
    - Hot-reload working for both containers
    
    Backend endpoints:
    - GET /health - Health check
    - POST /api/audit - Query package vulnerabilities
    
    Next: Test and polish the 3D frontend visualization

    Phase 0: Foundation - Docker setup with Flask backend and React frontend
    
    - Created Flask backend with health endpoint and OSV API integration
    - Created React frontend with Vite, Three.js, and TailwindCSS
    - Set up docker-compose with Chainguard base images
    - Configured hot-reload for both frontend and backend
    - Added Makefile with standard development commands
    - Created comprehensive README with usage instructions
    
    Technical decisions:
    - Using uv for Python dependency management
    - Using Chainguard images (python:latest-dev, node:latest-dev)
    - Volume mounts for hot-reload in development
    - Vite proxy configuration for API calls to backend
